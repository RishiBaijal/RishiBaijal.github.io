</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So my next task sounds challenging, but also fun. The project seems to be headed in a fresh direction. As a part of the next task, I have been assigned to study a thesis and a paper about the nilm-eval framework. This framework was built in order to provide a standard method to test nilm algorithms. The creators of this framework have tested it on four different algorithms - supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. The dataset used to test it was the ECO dataset.</p>
<p>I have gone through the paper and I now have some idea as to what the nilm-eval framework is all about. I will be reading the thesis in order to get a more detailed overview about the whole framework. Presumably, I will have to write code in order to get the nilm-eval framework to interact with the nilmtk framework. Since the former is in MATLAB and the latter is in python, I currently have no idea how to integrate the two, but we will see how things go. I am told that there exists every function in matlab has a counterpart in numpy, so that seems like a good thing. As usual, I will keep posting updates as frequently as possible.</p>                </article>
